Down the RabbitHole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alicestarted to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge.\",\n  \"environment\": \"bank, field, large rabbithole under the hedge\",\n  \"action\": \"Alice was considering making a daisychain when she saw a White Rabbit with pink eyes run by, then took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and popped down a rabbithole\",\n  \"Characters\": [\"Alice\", \"White Rabbit\"],\n  \"summary\": \"Alice gets tired of sitting by her sister and decides to make a daisychain.

The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.\",\n  \"environment\": \"wonderland\",\n  \"action\": \"falling down a well\",\n  \"characters\": [\n    \"Alice\"\n  ],\n  \"summary\": \"Alice falls down a deep well after following something without considering how to get back.

How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \u201cI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practiceto say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.\",\n  \"environment\": \"unknown\",\n  \"action\": \"Falling down and contemplating on the distance and location while falling\",\n  \"Characters\": [\n    \"Alice\"\n  ],\n  \"summary\": \"Alice takes down an empty jar labeled 'ORANGE MARMALADE' from a shelf while falling, thinking about the distance she is falling and wondering about Latitude and Longitude despite having no idea about them.\",\n  \"unknown\": \"unknown\"\n}",

Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much tonight, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milkat teatime.\",\n    \"environment\": \"Falling through the air\",\n    \"action\": \"Wondering about where she will end up and pondering on the people she might encounter\",\n    \"Characters\": [\n        \"Alice\"\n    ],\n    \"summary\": \"Alice wonders if she will fall through the earth and come out among people who walk with their heads downward.

There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There wasnot a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\",\n  \"environment\": \"wonderland\",\n  \"action\": \"walking, talking to herself, dreaming\",\n  \"Characters\": [\"Alice\", \"Dinah\", \"White Rabbit\"],\n  \"summary\": \"Alice is walking, talking to herself and dreaming about catching bats and asking if cats eat bats.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rathole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\",\n    \"environment\": \"in a hall with locked doors, a glass table, and a small passage with a garden\",\n    \"action\": \"trying to find a way out of the hall\",\n    \"Characters\": [\n        \"Alice\"\n    ],\n    \"summary\": \"Alice finds herself in a hall with locked doors and eventually discovers a tiny golden key that unlocks a small passage leading to a beautiful garden.\"\n}",

Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.' For, you see, so many outoftheway things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rulesfor shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME,' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\",\n    \"environment\": \"Dark hall with bright flowers, cool fountains, and a table with a mysterious bottle labeled 'DRINK ME.'\",\n    \"action\": \"Alice found a bottle labeled 'DRINK ME' on the table.\",\n    \"Characters\": [\n        \"Alice\"\n    ],\n    \"summary\": \"Alice wishes to shrink and finds a mysterious bottle labeled 'DRINK ME' on the table in the dark hall.\"\n}",

However, this bottle was not marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, asort of mixed flavour of cherrytart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\",\n    \"environment\": \"Alice's adventure in wonderland\",\n    \"action\": \"Alice decides to taste a drink after checking if it's marked as poison\",\n    \"Characters\": [\"Alice\"],\n    \"summary\": \"Alice, being cautious, checks if the bottle is marked 'poison' before tasting it.
